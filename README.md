## Quickstart

1) Server
```bash
cd server
npm install
# Create server/.env (see Environment)
npm run seed   # optional: seed demo users/content
npm run dev    # or: npm start
```

2) Client
```bash
cd client
npm install
# Create client/.env (see Environment)
npm run dev
```

Open the client at `http://localhost:5173` and the API at `http://localhost:5000`.

---

## Environment

Create `.env` files with your own secrets. Do not commit them.

### client/.env
```env
VITE_API_BASE=http://localhost:5000/api
VITE_CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

### server/.env
```env
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/gl_peer_platform
CLIENT_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173
JWT_SECRET=replace_me_with_a_long_random_secret
NODE_ENV=development
```

Production deployments can set:
- Client: `VITE_API_BASE=https://<your-server-domain>/api`
- Server: `CLIENT_ORIGIN=https://<your-client-domain>`

See `ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md` for ready‚Äëto‚Äëuse production values and tips.

## API Overview

Base URL: `/api`

- **Auth**: `POST /auth/register`, `POST /auth/login`, `GET /auth/me`, `POST /auth/refresh`, `POST /auth/logout`
- **Users**: `GET /users/:id`, `GET /users/search?username=`, `GET /users/suggest`
- **Follow**: `POST /follow/:id` (follow), `DELETE /follow/:id` (unfollow), lists for followers/following
- **Feed**: `GET /feed/global`, `GET /feed/following`
- **Notifications**: `GET /notifications`, `GET /notifications/unread-count`, `PATCH /notifications/:id/read`, `PATCH /notifications/mark-all-read`
- **Posts/Upload**: endpoints for posts and media upload

Authentication uses cookies; ensure your client includes credentials.

## Development Notes

- CORS is restricted to `CLIENT_ORIGIN`
- WebSocket events power real‚Äëtime notifications
- Use `npm run seed` to explore the app with demo users

## FAQ

- **Why cookies, not localStorage?**
  Cookies allow httpOnly tokens and better refresh flows.

- **Getting CORS errors?**
  Ensure `CLIENT_ORIGIN` and `VITE_API_BASE` match your actual origins.

- **DB not connecting?**
  Verify `MONGODB_URI` is reachable from your environment and IP allow‚Äëlisted.
