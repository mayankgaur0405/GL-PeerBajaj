# Search Functionality Test Guide

## Backend Search Fix

### What was fixed:
1. **Special Character Escaping**: The regex now properly escapes special characters like `.` in "test1.8"
2. **Case-insensitive Matching**: Search is now case-insensitive
3. **Partial Matching**: Returns users with partial matches in name or username
4. **Debug Logging**: Added console logs to help troubleshoot search issues

### How to test:

1. **Test Special Characters**:
   - Search for "test1.8" - should return users with that exact name
   - Search for "test1" - should return users with names containing "test1"
   - Search for "test" - should return all users with "test" in their name

2. **Test Case Insensitivity**:
   - Search for "TEST1.8" - should return same results as "test1.8"
   - Search for "Test1.8" - should return same results

3. **Test Partial Matching**:
   - Search for "test" - should return test1.8, test2.8, test3.8, etc.
   - Search for "1.8" - should return test1.8, user1.8, etc.

## Frontend Search Fix

### What was improved:
1. **Real-time Search**: Results appear as you type
2. **Dropdown Display**: Shows filtered users in a clean dropdown
3. **Debug Logging**: Added console logs to track search requests
4. **Error Handling**: Better error handling for failed searches

### How to test:

1. **Type in Search Bar**:
   - Start typing "test" - should see dropdown with matching users
   - Type "test1.8" - should show exact match
   - Click on any user - should navigate to their profile

2. **Check Console**:
   - Open browser dev tools
   - Look for "Frontend searching for:" logs
   - Check "Frontend search response:" logs

## Password Toggle Fix

### What was added:
1. **PasswordInput Component**: Reusable component with show/hide toggle
2. **Eye Icons**: Clean eye/eye-slash icons for toggle
3. **Mobile Friendly**: Works well on both desktop and mobile
4. **Accessibility**: Proper button attributes and focus handling

### How to test:

1. **Login Form**:
   - Go to /login
   - Click the eye icon in password field
   - Password should toggle between hidden/visible

2. **Signup Form**:
   - Go to /signup
   - Click the eye icon in password field
   - Password should toggle between hidden/visible

3. **Mobile Testing**:
   - Test on mobile device
   - Ensure icons are properly sized
   - Check touch interactions work

## Debugging

### Backend Logs:
Check server console for:
- "Search term: test1.8"
- "Escaped term: test1\.8"
- "Found users: X"
- "User names: [...]"

### Frontend Logs:
Check browser console for:
- "Frontend searching for: test1.8"
- "Frontend search response: {...}"

### Common Issues:
1. **No Results**: Check if user exists in database
2. **Special Characters**: Verify regex escaping is working
3. **Case Sensitivity**: Ensure case-insensitive search is working
4. **Frontend Not Updating**: Check API response format

## Expected Behavior

### Search "test1.8":
- Should return users with exact name "test1.8"
- Should return users with username "test1.8"
- Should be case-insensitive

### Search "test":
- Should return all users with "test" in name or username
- Should include test1.8, test2.8, test3.8, etc.

### Password Toggle:
- Click eye icon to show password
- Click eye-slash icon to hide password
- Should work on both login and signup forms
